# GitHub PR Manager

A text-based user interface (TUI) Python app for managing GitHub branches and pull requests using the `gh` CLI.

## Features
- Select a repository from a pre-configured list
- List, delete, or select branches
- Create, merge, and delete branches via PR in one step
- Interactive branch actions widget for deleting or merging via PR
- Edit the list of managed repositories within the TUI

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/)
- [textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual)

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
```bash
python main.py
```

## Repository and Branch Workflow

1. Launch the app and select a repository from the list defined in `config.json`.
2. The TUI displays the local branches for the chosen repository.
3. Use **Delete Branch** to remove the selected branch.
4. Use **PR/Merge/Delete** to create a pull request, merge it via the GitHub CLI, and delete the branch in one step.
5. From the repository selection screen you can open **Edit Repositories** to add or remove paths from the configuration.

## Configuration
Repository paths are stored in `config.json` at the project root. Each entry must
be the absolute path to a local Git repository. Invalid paths are ignored at
startup. You can edit this file directly or manage the list through the **Edit
Repositories** view in the TUI.
